# Data Processing:
#
# Develop data transformation processes to standardize and enrich the data. Handle data validation, filtering, and deduplication.
# Implement logic to correlate ad impressions with clicks and conversions to provide meaningful insights.
# Data Storage and Query Performance:
#
# Select an appropriate data storage solution for storing processed data efficiently, enabling fast querying for campaign performance analysis.
# Optimize the storage system for analytical queries and aggregations of ad campaign data.
# Error Handling and Monitoring:
#
# Create an error handling and monitoring system to detect data anomalies, discrepancies, or delays.
# Implement alerting mechanisms to address data quality issues in real-time, ensuring that discrepancies are resolved promptly to maintain ad campaign effectiveness.
